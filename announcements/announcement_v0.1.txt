ANN: ValidatedNumerics v0.1: Interval arithmetic and rigorous root finding

We are happy to announce the first release version of the ValidatedNumerics.jl package, a Julia package for doing rigorous floating-point calculations:

julia> Pkg.add("ValidatedNumerics")

The package provides an Interval type and operations defined on it in such a way that the result of any mathematical operations is *guaranteed* to
contain the true result. For example,

julia> julia> @interval sin(0.1) + cos(0.2)
[1.0798999944880696, 1.07989999448807]

Just wrapping an operation with the `@interval` macro automatically provides a guaranteed rigorous interval containing the true result (an "enclosure").

Interval arithmetic provides a means to develop new algorithms that also provide rigorous guaranteed results, for example for root finding.
The interval Newton method is implemented in the function `newton`, e.g.:

julia> f(x) = x^2 - 2
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> newton(f, @interval(-5, 5))
2-element Array{Root{Float64},1}:
 Root([-1.4142135623730951, -1.414213562373095], :unique)
 Root([1.414213562373095, 1.4142135623730951], :unique)

 The response from this function can be considered as a *mathematically rigorous proof* that the function f
 has exactly two roots in the interval [-5, 5], one in the first interval and the other in the second.

Currently root-finding functionality is restricted to one-variable real functions.
Please let us know if you have particularly tricky functions whose (non-multiple) roots you need to find!

Multi-dimensional root finding is planned for the future.
