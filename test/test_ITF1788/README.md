This folder contains the tests from the [ITF1788](https://github.com/oheim/ITF1788) testsuite developed by Oliver Heimlich. The Julia code was generated using [ITF1788.jl](https://github.com/juliaintervals/itf1788.jl). Instructions on how to generate locally the julia tests from the original tests specifications can be found in the ITF1788.jl [repository](https://github.com/juliaintervals/itf1788.jl).
