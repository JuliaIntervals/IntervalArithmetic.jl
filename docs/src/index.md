# IntervalArithmetic.jl #

`IntervalArithmetic.jl` is a Julia package for performing *Validated Numerics* in Julia, i.e. *rigorous* computations with finite-precision floating-point arithmetic.

All calculations are carried out using **interval arithmetic**: all quantities are treated as intervals, which are propagated throughout a calculation. The final result is an interval that is *guaranteed* to contain the correct result, starting from the given initial data.

The aim of the package is correctness over speed, although performance considerations are also taken into account.
