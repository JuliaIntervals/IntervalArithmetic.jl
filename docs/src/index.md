# IntervalArithmetic.jl

IntervalArithmetic.jl is a Julia package for validated numerics in Julia. All calculations are carried out using [interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic) where quantities are treated as intervals. The final result is a rigorous enclosure of the true value.



## Installation

```@repl
using Pkg # Julia v1.8 or above
redirect_stderr(devnull) do # hide
Pkg.add("IntervalArithmetic")
end # hide
```

## History

This project began in 2014 during a masters' course in the postgraduate programs of Mathematics and Physics at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. It was initially written in Python, then reinitiated in 2015 and rewritten in Julia. We thank the participants of the courses for their contribution, energy and ideas.
