`IntervalArithmetic.jl` is a Julia package for performing *Validated Numerics* in Julia, i.e. *rigorous* computations with finite-precision floating-point arithmetic.



## Installation
To install the package, from within Julia do

    julia> Pkg.add("IntervalArithmetic")


## Interval arithmetic
All calculations are carried out using **interval arithmetic**: all quantities are treated as intervals, which are propagated throughout a calculation. The final result is an interval that is *guaranteed* to contain the correct result, starting from the given initial data.

The aim of the package is correctness over speed, although performance considerations are also taken into account

## Documentation
Documentation is available [**here**](https://juliaintervals.github.io/IntervalArithmetic.jl/).

## IEEE Standard 1788-2015 - IEEE Standard for Interval Arithmetic
The IEEE Std 1788-2015 - IEEE Standard for Interval Arithmetic was [published](https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1788-2015.html) in June 2015. We are working towards having `IntervalArithmetic.jl` be conformant with this standard.

To do so, we have incorporated tests from the excellent [ITF1788 test suite](https://github.com/oheim/ITF1788), originally written by Marco Nehmeier and Maximilian Kiesner, and converted to a common format and to output tests for Julia by Oliver Heimlich.

## History ##
This project was begun during a masters' course in the postgraduate programs in Physics and in Mathematics at UNAM during the second semester of 2013 (in Python), and was reinitiated -- now in Julia -- in the first semester of 2015. We thank the participants of the courses for putting up with the half-baked material and contributing energy and ideas.
